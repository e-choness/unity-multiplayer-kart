# Unity Multiplayer Kart

A code along project to get familiar with Unity multiplayer game setups.

## Prerequisites

- Kart models: download from [Low Poly Models](https://opengameart.org/content/modular-karts), use .blend files under `BLEND` folder. Make sure install Blender for Unity to convert them into assets.
- Input settings can be configured as scriptable objects, a good trick to use and define `InputAction` behaviour before creating them as reusable configurations.
